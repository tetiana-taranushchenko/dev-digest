 * git-why (`GET /pulls/:id/why?file&line`).

 * A `WhyTimeline` answers "why does this line exist?" by walking git
 * blame/log (via `container.git`) for a file/line and reconstructing the
 * chain of commits — and, where the message references it, the PRs — that
 * shaped that line. Rendered as the `WhyTimeline` drawer (keyboard `w`).
 *
 * Owned by A3. Added as a NEW contract file; the barrel is wired by the
 * orchestrator (export * from './contracts/why.js').
